# Kwik Koder

Many coders are bottlenecked by lackluster typing skills, we aim to provide these developers with a place to hone their abilities and improve themselves. KwikKoder allows users to test their speed and accuracy by typing plain english as well as code snippets from over 60 different programming languages. Users can see how they stand against others using our leaderboard. The leaderboard aggregates user statistics for each category or gives an overall ranking. Users can also compete against their friends in asynchronous competitions. We reward users with revapoints through competition participation, and provide them with eye catching graphs that show their progress over time.
